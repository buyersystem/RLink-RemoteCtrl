RLink is a high-performance, open-source remote desktop and collaboration app for Windows, with low-latency desktop sharing at up to 4K and 120 FPS. Start a remote assistance session with a device ID and a one-time code, or sign in to connect directly to your own online devices. RLink also brings group voice and video calls, screen sharing, and remote control into a single client.

## Download

The download buttons above link to **v0.1.12**. The ready-to-run packages do not require Qt, WebRTC, or a development environment.

| Package | Download | Getting started |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows x64 installer (recommended) | [Download installer](https://github.com/dyhwdnmd/RLink-RemoteCtrl/releases/download/v0.1.12/RLink-Setup-0.1.12.exe) | Run the installer; recommended for regular use and future updates |
| Windows x64 portable | [Download ZIP](https://github.com/dyhwdnmd/RLink-RemoteCtrl/releases/download/v0.1.12/RLink-Portable-Windows-x64-0.1.12.zip) | Extract the entire archive, then run `RLinkAPP.exe`; useful for testing or occasional use |

[Latest release and other versions](https://github.com/dyhwdnmd/RLink-RemoteCtrl/releases) ·
[Installer SHA-256](https://github.com/dyhwdnmd/RLink-RemoteCtrl/releases/download/v0.1.12/RLink-Setup-0.1.12.exe.sha256.txt) ·
[Portable ZIP SHA-256](https://github.com/dyhwdnmd/RLink-RemoteCtrl/releases/download/v0.1.12/RLink-Portable-Windows-x64-0.1.12.zip.sha256.txt)

Both packages include the required runtime files. For the portable version, keep the extracted DLLs, plugins, and other files together—do not move the EXE on its own.
`RLink-Windows-x64-0.1.12.zip` is for automatic updates of existing installations, not portable use. The `Source code` downloads contain source archives, and `RLink-update.json` is the client's update manifest; neither is an installer.

### Get started

1. Install or extract RLink on the Windows computers you want to connect, then sign in.
2. Choose the workflow that fits your session:
   - **Remote assistance:** enter the other computer's 9-digit device ID and 6-digit one-time code to start a session.
   - **My devices:** sign in to the same account on both computers, then open a remote desktop from the online device list.
   - **Collaboration rooms:** create or join a room to use voice, video, or screen sharing. Request control from the person sharing their screen when you need to interact with it.

Remote sessions use WebRTC P2P connections. Connectivity depends on the networks at both ends. If a connection cannot be established, check that your firewall allows RLink to access the network, or try another network or a mobile hotspot.
Actual resolution and frame rate depend on the host's capture hardware and encoder, available bandwidth, and the receiving computer's decoding capabilities.

## Screenshots

### Collaboration rooms

Create or join a room where participants can request screen access, request control, and take over screen sharing.

![RLink collaboration room](assets/readme/collaboration-room.png)

### Remote assistance

The host provides a 9-digit device ID and a one-time code. Enter both on the other computer to start a remote assistance session.

![RLink remote assistance](assets/readme/remote-assistance.png)

### My devices

Online devices linked to the same RLink account appear automatically. Open a remote desktop directly from the device list.

### Recent connections

Return to recently used devices and rooms, with information about connection type and availability.

![RLink recent connections](assets/readme/recent-connections.png)

### File transfer

Files travel directly over the established P2P connection, not through the signaling server.

## Technology and self-hosting

RLink is built with **C++20, Qt 6, libwebrtc, and FFmpeg**. Qt powers the native desktop interface and WSS signaling client. libwebrtc handles audio/video, DataChannels, congestion control, and connection recovery. Windows capture, encoding, decoding, and rendering use **Direct3D 11, DXGI, and Media Foundation**. Account sign-in and authentication use **Logto**.

The repository includes a signaling server that can be deployed independently. A self-hosted deployment needs a reachable signaling endpoint, TLS certificates, and the appropriate authentication configuration. Production account sign-in requires Logto. Keep secrets, tokens, and local deployment configuration out of the public repository.

## Build from source

Requirements: CMake 3.24+, Visual Studio 2022 with the v143 toolset, the Windows SDK, Qt 6.11.x for MSVC 2022 x64, and WebRTC built with `/MD`.

Set the dependency paths through `RLINK_QT_DIR`, `RLINK_WEBRTC_SRC`, and `RLINK_WEBRTC_OUT`, or copy `cmake\local.bat.example` to `cmake\local.bat` and fill in your local paths. This file is ignored by Git. Do not store signaling tokens, certificate private keys, or other credentials in it.

For a fresh Windows setup, start with [Building RLink on Windows](BUILDING.md). The detailed [Chinese build guide](Windows源码构建指南.md) also covers Qt components, the pinned libwebrtc commit, GN arguments, dependency checks, and common linker errors.

```powershell
.\cmake_configure.bat
cmake --build --preset windows-msvc-x64-v143-release -j
```

Alternatively, use the CMake presets directly: run `cmake --preset windows-msvc-x64-v143`, followed by `cmake --build --preset windows-msvc-x64-v143-release -j`.

To browse or build the project in Visual Studio, configure it first, then open `build\RLinkRemoteCtrl.sln`. `build\RLink.sln` and `ControllerApp.vcxproj` are legacy build artifacts, not the current entry points.

For a Debug build, use `cmake --build --preset windows-msvc-x64-v143-debug -j` after preparing a Debug WebRTC build as described in the build guide.

The main outputs are in `x64\Release`:

- `RLinkAPP.exe`: the RLink client, used for both controlling and sharing a desktop.
- `RLinkUpdater.exe`: a separate updater launched by the client after an update is confirmed.
- `RemoteCSignalServer.exe`: the RLink WSS signaling server.

The public repository includes what is needed to build the source, self-host the signaling service, and build the FFmpeg dependencies. Installer packaging, official release signing, and GitHub/CNB release publishing are handled locally by the maintainer and are not part of the public source-build workflow.

Desktop capture and hardware codecs depend on the active Windows session, displays, and drivers. Before shipping a build, run two-computer smoke tests covering room creation/joining, screen sharing/handover, control and `ReleaseAll`, 30/60/120 FPS, both capture methods, file transfer, cameras/microphones, and ICE restart.

## Repository layout

- Repository root: build entry points (`CMakeLists.txt`, `CMakePresets.json`, and `cmake_configure.bat`) and documentation.
- `cmake`: dependency configuration, target definitions, and local build configuration templates.
- `src`: client, server, and feature modules.
- `assets`: icons, SVGs, themes, fonts, and Windows resources.
- `third_party`: third-party dependencies used to build or run the project.
- `scripts`: helpers for building FFmpeg dependencies and deploying or starting the public signaling service.
- `tools`: source navigation and public-asset maintenance utilities.

## Explore the source

Use the [source navigation index](源码导航/README.md) to find classes, member variables, and functions by file. It covers the C/C++ files under `src`, with clickable source line links and an automatic update script.

## Report an issue

Bug reports and suggestions are welcome on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dyhwdnmd/RLink-RemoteCtrl/issues). Include your client version, Windows version, connection type, steps to reproduce, and relevant diagnostics. Before uploading screenshots or logs, redact email addresses, device IDs, one-time codes, access tokens, and other sensitive information.
